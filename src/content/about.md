title: About
---

I'm a second year Computer Science student at Carleton University with honors in Internet Security. React and GraphQL enthusiast. In my free time I contribute to Open Source projects. Currently working on [ShabadOS mobile app](https://github.com/shabados/mobile) and [GraphQL JS TypeScript migration](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/2860).

I am interested in web development, mobile development, serverless computing, developer tooling, distributed systems, and cloud infrastructure.
