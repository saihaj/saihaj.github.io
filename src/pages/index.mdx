Greetings!

I am a second year computer science student at Carleton University with honors in Internet Security.

I am interested in web development, mobile development, serverless computing, developer tooling, distributed systems, and cloud infrastructure.

In my free time I contribute to Open Source projects. I help maintain [shabados/theme-tool](https://github.com/shabados/theme-tool#people) and [shabados/docs](https://github.com/shabados/docs#people). Member of [GraphQL JS working group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js-wg). Working on [redesign of shabados.com](https://github.com/shabados/website#people), [ShabadOS mobile app](https://github.com/shabados/mobile/graphs/contributors) and [migrating GraphQL JS to TypeScript](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/2828).
